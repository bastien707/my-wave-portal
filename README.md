# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

## Deploy contract

Commands that will help you to deploy the smart contract.

### Local deployment
```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/file.js
```

### Deploy on ethereum **rinkeby** testnet
```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```
